# Delegate Influence

<summary>
**Distribute the power to influence, to enable people to decide and act for themselves within defined constraints.**
</summary>

A [delegator](glossary:delegator) can support [delegatees](glossary:delegatee) to deliver value by:

-   Clearly defining [domains](glossary:domain) of autonomy and responsibility
-   Ensuring there are opportunities for learning and development
-   Providing support if required

Adjust constraints incrementally, considering capabilities, reliability and outcome.

Decentralize as much as possible, and retain as much influence as necessary.

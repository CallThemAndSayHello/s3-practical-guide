# Consent Decision Making

<summary>
**A (facilitated) group process for decision making: invite objections, and consider information and knowledge revealed to further evolve proposals or existing agreements.**
</summary>

Proposals become [agreements](glossary:agreement) when they are considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_ until the next review.

Unresolved [objections](glossary:objection) prevent proposals from becoming agreements.

Withholding objections can harm the objectives of a team or organization.

## Implicit Contract of Consent

1.   In the absence of objections to an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
2.   I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.

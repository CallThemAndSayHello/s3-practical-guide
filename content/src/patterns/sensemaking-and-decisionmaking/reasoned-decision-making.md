# Reasoned Decision Making

<summary>
**Engage in productive dialogue by investigating different perspectives and the knowledge of participants, to reach agreement on what is considered relevant, valid or empirically true.**
</summary>

There are many paths people can follow to arrive at a decision with others (majority, consensus, authoritative, etc), but for any approach that uses reason as a basis for that agreement, they typically follow a similar pattern of _Reasoned Decision Making_. 

The steps of the process:

-   **Present** the subject for investigation (this could be an argument, or a proposal for how to proceed).
-   **Understand** the subject (e.g. through clarifying questions).
Check if there are any disagreements on the relevance, validity or truthfulness of the subject (e.g. using hand signs).
-   If there are any disagreements, take one at a time and:
    -   **Dispute**: check if the argument put forward makes sense (using the same process).
    -   **Integrate** information revealed in the previous step to improve the subject.
If there is no disagreement, or after all disputes have been resolved, **celebrate** reaching agreement.

How people undergo each of these steps varies and depends a lot on culture, context, preference, the number of people involved, and on whether they are communicating asynchronously or meeting face-to-face. 

## Mapping Reasoned Decision Making to other patterns in S3

Reasoned Decision Making is reflected in all of the S3 process patterns that support groups to reach agreement. Understanding this meta-pattern helps people to more effectively apply them:

-   [Consent Decision Making](section:consent-decision-making]), for testing if a proposal or existing agreement is good enough and safe enough. And, within this, two nested patterns:
-   [Test Arguments Qualify as Objections](section:test-arguments-qualify-as-objections), for testing if arguments qualify as objections and only acting on those that do.
-   [Resolve Objections](section:resolve-objections), for using the information revealed by objections to make and evolve agreements. 

Each of the three processes focuses on the investigation of a different subject: 

-    In _Consent Decision Making_ the subject is a **proposal**.
-    In _Test Argument Qualifies as an Objection_ the subject is an **argument**.
-    In _Resolving Objections_ - the subject is a **proposed amendment**. 

Mapping the steps of RDM to the other S3 decision-making processes

| Reasoned Decision Making | Consent Decision Making | Test Argument Qualifies as an Objection | Resolve Objection  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| **Present** | proposal | argument | amendment |
| **Understand** | Any questions to understand the subject? |||
| **Check** | Any objections? | Any disagreement? | Any objections? | 
| **Dispute** | Test Argument Qualifies as an Objection | Investigate disagreements to the argument (using the same process) | Test Argument Qualifies as an Objection | 
| **Integrate** | Resolve Objection | Amend argument or drop it | Integrate information revealed by objections, to evolve the proposal | 
| **Celebrate** | You’ve reached agreement | You’ve qualified an argument | You’ve agreed on an amendment. Zoom out to the whole proposal to check for further objections |

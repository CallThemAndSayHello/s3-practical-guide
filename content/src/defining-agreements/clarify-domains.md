## Clarify Domains

<summary>
**A clear understanding of people's area of responsibility and autonomy enables greater efficiency, effective collaboration and agility throughout an organization.**
</summary>

A simple way to clarify [domains](glossary:domain) is with a **domain description** that contains:

-   [primary driver](glossary:primary-driver) (the **organizational need** the domain is designed to respond to)
-   **key responsibilities** (key deliverables, any critical risks to manage, other essential work and decision making being delegated)
-   **constraints to the autonomy and influence** of those the domain is [delegated](glossary:delegation) to (the _delegatees_), usually related to the organization itself (dependencies, involvement of the [delegator](glossary:delegator), reporting etc.)
-   **resources** (time, money, facilities, privileges, tools)
-   **evaluation criteria** and frequency of evaluation
-   term (for a role)

Domain descriptions can be created for a [role](section:role), position, [circle](section:circle), [team](glossary:team), [open domain](section:open-domain), department, unit, or the whole organization.

Another way of clarifying a domain is by filling out an [S3 Delegation Canvas](http://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/s3-delegation-canvas.html).

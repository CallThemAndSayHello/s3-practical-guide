## Open Domain

<summary>
**Intentionally account for a domain by invitation rather than assignment and request that those invited contribute when they can.**
</summary>

The [delegator](glossary:delegator) of the open domain clarifies:
 
- the [primary driver](glossary:primary-driver), key responsibilities and constraints of the open domain
- who is invited to contribute to the open domain
- constraints relating to the delegator's participation in the open domain's [governance](glossary:governance)

Depending on the constraints set by the delegator, contributors may only [organize and do work](glossary:operations), or take part in governance as well.

A delegator is accountable for conducting regular reviews to support effectiveness of work and any decision making done in an open domain.

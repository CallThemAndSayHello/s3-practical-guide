## Respond to Organizational Drivers

**Clarify organizational drivers (i.e. what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization), and respond as required.**

Responses to [organizational drivers](glossary:organizational-driver) include:

- direct action ([operations](glossary:operations))
- organizing how work will be done 
- making governance decisions

The response to an organizational driver is typically treated as an experiment that is evaluated and evolved over time.

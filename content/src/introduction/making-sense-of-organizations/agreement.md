### Agreements

{{define:agreement}}

Shared guidelines about why, how and when to act, and what is specifically required, enable effective collaboration.

Agreements are created in response to [organizational drivers](glossary:organizational-driver), are **regularly reviewed** and evolved as necessary.

**Overall accountability** for an agreement lies with the people that make them.

An agreement can include **delegation of specific responsibilities** to individuals or groups.

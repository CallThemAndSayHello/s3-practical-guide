### Patterns 

S3 offers a pattern-based approach to organizational change. 

A **pattern** is a process, practice or guideline that serves as a template for successfully responding to a specific kind of challenge or opportunity. S3 patterns are discovered through observing people working together in organizations to solve problems and respond to opportunities they face. When you find that your habitual ways of doing things fail to bring about the outcomes you expected or hope for, you can look to S3 for patterns that might help.

The patterns are grouped by topic into ten categories to help you more easily identify those that are useful to you. They are modular and adaptable, can be used independently, and are mutually reinforcing, complementing one another when used in combination. S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to address your specific needs.

By providing a menu of patterns to choose from according to need, S3 encourages an organic, **iterative approach to change without a huge upfront investment** . It meets people where they are and helps them move forward pulling in patterns at their own pace and according to their unique context.

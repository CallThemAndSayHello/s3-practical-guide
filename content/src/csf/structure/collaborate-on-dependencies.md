# Principle 7 – Collaborate on Dependencies


**_Co-create and evolve a coherent system to deal with all dependencies, so that you deliver value fast when dependencies cannot be avoided._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Navigate via Tension](section:navigate-via-tension.html) – Everyone in the organization paying attention to dependencies maximises the potential for unmanaged dependencies to be identified and responded to.
-   [Clarify and Develop Domains](section:clarify-and-develop-domains.html) – When people understand their own areas of responsibility, and those of others too, they also understand where collaboration on dependencies will be necessary.
-   [Visualize Work](section:visualize-work.html) – Visualizing work items and the dependencies between them, makes it easier to manage dependencies in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders. 
-   [Respond to Organizational Drivers](section:respond-to-organizational-drivers.html) Understanding why a dependency exists in the first place, and ensuring it is taken care of, is essential for collaborating on managing or resolving dependencies. 
-   [Involve Those Affected](section:those-affected-decide.html) – To address dependencies in an effective way, it often helps to gather the perspectives of all (relevant) stakeholders and involve them in the decision making process.
-   [Linking](section:linking.html) – Dependencies between two teams can often be addressed effectively by sending a [Representative](section:representative.html) to the decision making of the other team, to ensure all relevant perspectives are considered and ownership of decisions is shared.
-   [Delegate Circle](section:delegate-circle.html) – Delegating the power to make and evolve agreements for how to deal with specific dependencies between teams, to a circle of representatives, brings together relevant perspectives and generates ownership among stakeholders. 
-   [Align Flow](section:align-flow.html) – Moving decision making close to where value is created, brings together the people necessary for making decisions in response to specific dependencies and eliminates unnecessary decision making bottlenecks.
-   [Create a Pull-System for Organizational Change](section:create-a-pull-system-for-organizational-change.html) – Inviting and enabling people to make changes to organizational structure, when doing so provides an effective way for dealing with dependencies they share responsibility for, facilitates the ongoing evolution of a coherent and effective organization.

# Principle 10 – Build Shared Mental Models


**_Invest in building shared mental models, so that everyone can engage in meaningful dialogue about what’s happening and what needs to be done, and in the process deepen their understanding of how the organization works, what it does and why._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Navigate via Tension](section:navigate-via-tension) – Everyone in the organization paying attention for situations that might benefit from building or refining a shared mental model,  gets people on the same page so that they can engage in productive dialogue.
-   [Clarify and Develop Domains](section:clarify-and-develop-domains) – Explicitly clarifying and documenting areas of  responsibility ensures a shared mental model regarding expectations and responsibilities.
-   [Clarify Intended Outcome](section:clarify-intended-outcome) – By first agreeing on the intended outcome of a proposed activity, project or agreement, people develop shared understanding of where things should be headed and can then engage in productive dialog about how to get there.

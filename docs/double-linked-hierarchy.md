title: "Double-Linked Hierarchy"
---


**Delegate all authority for making governance decisions to self-governing circles, double-linked across all levels of the hierarchy, to transition from an traditional hierarchy towards a structure more suitable for tapping collective intelligence, ensuring equivalence and building engagement.**

1. Shift governance decision making from individuals to teams by forming <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives.">self-governing</a> <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Circle: A self-governing and semi-autonomous team of equivalent people who collaborate to account for a domain.">circles</a> on all levels of your organization.
2. Each circle's members select one of their group to represent their interests and participate in the <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives.">governance</a> decision making of the next higher circle, and vice versa.

A double-linked hierarchy:

- brings equivalence to governance
- maintains the potential for a functional hierarchy (if it enables the flow of value).

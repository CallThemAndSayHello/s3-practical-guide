_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value._

Shared guidelines about why, how and when to act, and what is specifically required, enable effective collaboration.

Agreements are created in response to <dfn data-info="Organizational Driver: A driver is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.">organizational drivers</dfn>, are **regularly reviewed** and evolved as necessary.

**Overall accountability** for an agreement lies with the people that make them.

An agreement can include **delegation of specific responsibilities** to individuals or groups.

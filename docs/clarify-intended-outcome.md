title: "Clarify Intended Outcome"
---


**Be explicit about the expected results of agreements, activities, projects and strategies.**

Agree on and record a concise description of the intended outcome.

The intended outcome can be used to define [Evaluation Criteria](evaluation-criteria.html) and <dfn data-info="Metric: A quantifiable measure used to track and assess progress, evaluate outcomes and determine success">metrics</dfn> for reviewing actual outcome.

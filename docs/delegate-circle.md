Governance decisions made in a delegate circle are acted upon in the various <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domains</a> it serves.

Delegate circles provide a way of steering organizations in alignment with the <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Flow of Value: Deliverables traveling through an organization towards customers or other stakeholders.">flow of value</a>, and bring a diversity of perspectives to governance decision making.

A delegate circle may bring in other people (e.g. external experts) to help with specific decisions, or even as a member of the circle.

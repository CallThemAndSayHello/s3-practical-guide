title: "Involve Those Affected"
---


**Involve people in making decisions that affect them, to maintain equivalence and accountability, and to increase the amount of information available on the subject.**

For larger groups:

-   facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates
-   use an online tool and conduct an asynchronous, [timeboxed](timebox-activities.html) and staged process

Consider including those affected in reviewing and evolving decisions, too.

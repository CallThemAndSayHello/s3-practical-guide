title: "Limit Work in Progress"
---


**Limit the number of work items in any stage of your work process.**

Work in progress includes:

-   the number of items in a <dfn data-info="Backlog: A list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or drivers that need to be addressed.">backlog</dfn>
-   concurrent projects or tasks for teams or individuals
-   products in a portfolio

When an action would exceed an agreed upon limit of work items in progress, this needs to be brought up with the team before continuing.

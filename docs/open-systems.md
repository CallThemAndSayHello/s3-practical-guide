**Intentionally communicate with and learn from others outside of your system.**

Individuals, teams and entire organizations can acknowledge interdependence and intentionally invite people from outside their system to bring in **knowledge, experience and influence** to assist with decision making and support collective learning.

-   **External experts** can offer an outside perspective and bring knowledge, understanding and skills
-   **Representatives of affected parties** can inform and influence decision making in ways that benefit overall objectives (see [Involve Those Affected ](involve-those-affected.html))

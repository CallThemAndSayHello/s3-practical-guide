A person fulfilling the role of a coordinator is accountable for **coordinating a domain's operations** and is **selected for a limited term.**

The coordinator may be selected by the team itself, or by the <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</dfn>.

Several coordinators may collaborate to synchronize work across multiple <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domains</dfn>.

Instead of selecting a coordinator, a team may choose to self-organize.

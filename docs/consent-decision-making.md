title: "Consent Decision Making"
---


**A (facilitated) group process for decision making: invite objections, and consider information and knowledge revealed to further evolve proposals or existing agreements.**

Proposals become <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Agreement: An agreed upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</a> when they are considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_ until the next review.

Unresolved <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Objection: An argument – relating to a proposal, agreement, activity or the existing state of affairs – that reveals consequences or risks you&#x27;d rather avoid, or demonstrates worthwhile ways to improve.">objections</a> prevent proposals from becoming agreements.

Withholding objections can harm the objectives of a team or organization.

## Implicit Contract of Consent

1.   In the absence of objections to an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
2.   I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.

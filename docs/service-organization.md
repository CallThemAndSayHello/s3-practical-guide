**Multi-stakeholder collaboration and alignment towards a shared driver (or objective).**

-   increases cross-departmental/organizational alignment
-   supports multi-agency collaboration between departments or organizations with different primary motives, or that are in conflict
-   suitable for one-off projects, or ongoing collaboration

**Note:** a service organization is sometimes referred to as a **backbone organization**.

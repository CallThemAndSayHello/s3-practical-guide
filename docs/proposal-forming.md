title: "Proposal Forming"
---


**A (facilitated) group process for co-creating a response to a driver.**

-   draws on the collective intelligence and diversity of perspective within a group
-   involves people in co-creating agreements
-   fosters accountability and sense of ownership

_Proposal Forming_ may also be used by an individual.

## Proposal Forming Steps

**Consent to driver:** Briefly present the <dfn data-info="Organizational Driver: A driver is a person’s or a group&#x27;s motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.">driver</dfn>. _Is this driver relevant for us to respond to? Are there any essential amendments to what has been presented?_

**Deepen shared understanding of driver:** invite essential questions to understand the driver in more detail.

**Collect considerations** phrased as questions relating to possible solutions. Questions either reveal constraints (information gathering questions) or possibilities (generative questions).

**Answer** any information gathering questions if possible.

**Prioritize** considerations.

**Gather ideas** as possible ingredients for a proposal.

**Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by a smaller group of "tuners".

## Choosing Tuners

Consider:

-   who should be there?
-   who wants to be there?
-   who else may have a valuable contribution to make?
-   consider expertise, outside view, and inspiration

Between two and three tuners is usually appropriate. Check for any objections to the proposed tuner(s).

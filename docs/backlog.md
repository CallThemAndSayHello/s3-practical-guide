title: "Backlog"
---


_A **backlog** (to-do-list) is a list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables), or (drivers) that need to be addressed._

Consider making backlogs visible, not only to other members of a team, but also to the wider organization.

Types of backlog include:

-   <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives.">governance</a> backlog
-   <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">operations</a> backlog
-   [sprint](planning-and-review-meetings.html) backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog

**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog:** sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog:** e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)

Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** of a <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Deliverable: A product, service, component or material provided in response to an organizational driver.">deliverable</a> or a <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: A driver is a person’s or a group&#x27;s motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.">driver</a>
-   a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
-   (the **order of work items**)
-   **dependencies** to other work items or projects
-   **due date** (if necessary)
-   (optional) a measure for **value**
-   (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)

title: "Evaluation Criteria"
---


**Develop well-defined evaluation criteria to determine if acting on an agreement had the desired effect.**

-   go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (to avoid discussion or unnecessary dialogue when reviewing your <dfn data-info="Agreement: An agreed upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</dfn>)
-   define **actionable <dfn data-info="Metric: A quantifiable measure used to track and assess progress, evaluate outcomes and determine success">metrics</dfn>** to continuously track effects and spot deviations from <dfn data-info="Intended Outcome: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.">intended outcome</dfn>
-   consider adding criteria which make it explicit when the outcome of an agreement would be considered **unsuccessful**
-   when reviewing an agreement, consider **evolving the evaluation criteria** based on what you have learned

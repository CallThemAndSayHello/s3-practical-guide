title: "Create a Pull-System For Organizational Change"
---


**Create an environment that invites and enables members of the organization to drive change.**

Change things when there is value in doing so:

-   Bring in patterns that help to solve current and important problems.
-   Don't break what's already working!
-   Meet everyone where they are …
-   … and let them choose their own pace.

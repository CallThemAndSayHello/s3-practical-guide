**Deliver value in complex and competitive environments through _decentralization_ (of resources and influence) and _direct interaction_ between those creating value and the customers they serve.**

Teams in the periphery:

-   deliver value in direct exchange with the outside world (customers, partners, communities, municipalities etc.)
-   steward the monetary resources and steer the organization

The center provides internal services to support the organization.

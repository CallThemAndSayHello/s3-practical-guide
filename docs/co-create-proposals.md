</div></div>

There are many ways to co-create proposals. They typically follow a similar pattern:

1. Agree on the <a href="glossary.html#entry-organizational-driver" class="glossary-tooltip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: A driver is a personâ€™s or a group&#x27;s motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.">driver</a> (or problem / opportunity / need)
2. Explore the topic and understand constraints
3. Generate ideas
4. Design a proposal (often done by a smaller group)

One way to co-create proposals is to use S3's [Proposal Forming](proposal-forming.html) pattern.

For inspiration for steps 2 and 3, look to classic group facilitation techniques or design thinking activities.

Besides in a face-to-face workshop, you can adapt this process for online meetings. You can even use it asynchronously (and over an extended period of time) to include many people.

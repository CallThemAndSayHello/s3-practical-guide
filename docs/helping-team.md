**Bring together a team of equivalent people with the mandate to execute on a specific set of requirements defined by a delegator.**

A helping team:

-   is a way for a <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</dfn> to expand their capacity
-   may be self-organizing, or guided by a [coordinator](coordinator.html) chosen by the delegator
-   is governed by the delegator
-   benefits from a clearly defined <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domain</dfn>

Members of the helping team:

-   can object to the delegator's decisions that affect them
-   can add items to the delegator's <dfn data-info="Governance Backlog: A visible, prioritized list of items (drivers) that are related to governing a domain and require attention.">governance backlog</dfn>
-   may be invited to select a [representative](representative.html) to participate in the governance decision making of the delegator

title: "Principle 5 – Run Experiments"
---



**_Run experiments to address complex challenges, so that you learn how to move closer to where you want to be._**

Essential patterns to help you achieve this:

-   [Describe Organizational Drivers](describe-organizational-drivers.html.html) – Building a shared mental model of the situation you want to address, is essential for successfully designing, running and later on, evaluating experiments. 
-   [Clarify Intended Outcome](clarify-intended-outcome.html.html) – A clear description of the intended outcome of an experiment is essential for understanding whether or not an experiment produced the intended result.
-   [Evaluation Criteria](evaluation-criteria.html.html) – Defining clear criteria for determining success before the start of an experiment, helps to reveal flaws in its design and supports effective evaluation of outcomes. 
-   [Consent Decision Making](consent-decision-making.html.html) – An effective group process for viewing a proposition from a diversity of perspectives and testing whether or not an experiment is good enough and safe enough to run.
-   [Evaluate and Evolve Agreements](evaluate-and-evolve-agreements.html.html) – An experiment needs to be regularly reviewed to determine what outcomes it achieves, and as a consequence, potentially adapted or even stopped.
-   [Limit Work in Progress](limit-work-in-progress.html.html) – Limit the number of concurrent experiments  to avoid overwhelm and maintain a steady flow of value. 
-   [Create A Pull-System for Organizational Change](create-a-pull-system-for-organizational-change.html.html) – Inviting and enabling people to run experiments when they discover organizational needs allows for effective and decentralized adaption of the organization.

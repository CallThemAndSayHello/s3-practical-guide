<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">People pull in new work items when they have capacity (instead of having work pushed or assigned to them).
</div></div>

Pulling in work prevents overloading the system, especially when [work in progress (WIP) per person or team is limited](limit-work-in-progress.html).

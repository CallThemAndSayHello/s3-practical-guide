title: "Respond to Organizational Drivers"
---


**Clarify organizational drivers (i.e. what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization), and respond as required.**

Responses to <dfn data-info="Organizational Driver: A driver is a person’s or a group&#x27;s motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.">organizational drivers</dfn> include:

- direct action (<dfn data-info="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">operations</dfn>)
- organizing how work will be done
- making governance decisions

The response to an organizational driver is typically treated as an experiment that is evaluated and evolved over time.

## Qualify Drivers as Organizational Drivers

A driver is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.

A simple way to qualify whether or not a driver falls within an organization's <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domain</dfn> is by checking:

_Would it help the organization if we respond to this driver? Or would it lead to unintended consequences if we don't?_

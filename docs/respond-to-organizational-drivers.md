**Clarify organizational drivers (i.e. what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization), and respond as required.**

Responses to <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Organizational Driver: A driver is a person’s or a group&#x27;s motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.">organizational drivers</a> include:

- direct action (<a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Operations: Doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within the constraints defined through governance.">operations</a>)
- organizing how work will be done
- making governance decisions

The response to an organizational driver is typically treated as an experiment that is evaluated and evolved over time.

## Qualify Drivers as Organizational Drivers

A driver is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation. A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid unintended consequences.

A simple way to qualify whether or not a driver falls within an organization's <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision-making within an organization.">domain</a> is by checking:

_Would it help the organization if we respond to this driver? Or would it lead to unintended consequences if we don't?_

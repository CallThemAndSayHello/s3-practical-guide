title: "Breaking Agreements"
---


**Break agreements when you are certain the benefit for the organization outweighs the cost of waiting to amend that agreement first, and take responsibility for any consequences.**

Breaking <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Agreement: An agreed upon guideline, process, protocol or policy designed to guide the flow of value.">agreements</a> is sometimes **necessary** but may come at a **cost** to the community.

Be accountable:

-   **clean up** disturbances
-   **follow up** as soon as possible with those affected
-   **change the agreement** instead of repeatedly breaking it

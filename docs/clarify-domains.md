title: "Clarify Domains"
---


**A clear understanding of people's area of responsibility and autonomy enables greater efficiency, effective collaboration and agility throughout an organization.**

A simple way to clarify <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domains</dfn> is with a **domain description** that contains:

-   <dfn data-info="Primary Driver: The primary driver for a domain is the main driver that people who account for that domain respond to.">primary driver</dfn> (the **organizational need** the domain is designed to respond to)
-   **key responsibilities** (key deliverables, any critical risks to manage, other essential work and decision making being delegated)
-   **constraints to the autonomy and influence** of those the domain is <dfn data-info="Delegation: The grant of authority by one party (the delegator) to another (the delegatee) to account for a domain, (i.e. to do certain things and/or to make certain decisions) for which the delegator maintains overall accountability.">delegated</dfn> to (the _delegatees_), usually related to the organization itself (dependencies, involvement of the <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</dfn>, reporting etc.)
-   **resources** (time, money, facilities, privileges, tools)
-   **evaluation criteria** and frequency of evaluation
-   term (for a role)

Domain descriptions can be created for a [role](role.html), position, [circle](circle.html), <dfn data-info="Team: A group of people collaborating toward a shared driver (or objective). Typically a team is part of an organization, or it is formed as a collaboration of several organizations.">team</dfn>, [open domain](open-domain.html), department, unit, or the whole organization.

Another way of clarifying a domain is by filling out an [S3 Delegation Canvas](http://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/s3-delegation-canvas.html).

<div class="card summary"><div class="card-body">Adapt and evolve S3 patterns to suit your specific context.
</div></div>
Ensure that everyone affected:

-   understands why changing the pattern is necessary (or helpful)
-   is present or represented when deciding how to change it
-   uses S3 principles as a guide for adaptation.

Run experiments with adaptations for long enough to learn about the benefits and any potential pitfalls.

Share valuable adaptations with the S3 community.

_A **driver** is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation._

Drivers:

-   can be used to derive goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
-   can change over time

## Drivers, Value and Waste

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver._

_**Waste** is anything unnecessary for — or standing in the way of — a (more) effective response to a driver._

By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:

-   value stream mapping
-   various strategies for eliminating waste
-   the Kanban Method

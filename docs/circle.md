-   may be <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Self-Organization: Any activity or process through which people organize work. Self-organization happens within the constraints of a domain, but without the direct influence of  external agents. In any organization or team, self-organization co-exists with external influence (e.g. external objections or governance decisions that affect the domain).">self-organizing</a>

    -   All members of a circle are equally accountable for <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Governance: The process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives.">governance</a> of the circle's domain.

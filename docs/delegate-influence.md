title: "Delegate Influence"
---


**Distribute the power to influence, to enable people to decide and act for themselves within defined constraints.**

A <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</a> can support <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Delegatee: An individual or group accepting responsibility for a domain delegated to them, becoming a role keeper or a team.">delegatees</a> to deliver value by:

-   Clearly defining <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision-making within an organization.">domains</a> of autonomy and responsibility
-   Ensuring there are opportunities for learning and development
-   Providing support if required

Adjust constraints incrementally, considering capabilities, reliability and outcome.

Decentralize as much as possible, and retain as much influence as necessary.

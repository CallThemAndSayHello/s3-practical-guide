title: "Delegate Influence"
---


**Distribute the power to influence, to enable people to decide and act for themselves within defined constraints.**

A <dfn data-info="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</dfn> can support <dfn data-info="Delegatee: An individual or group accepting responsibility for a domain delegated to them, becoming a role keeper or a team.">delegatees</dfn> to deliver value by:

-   Clearly defining <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domains</dfn> of autonomy and responsibility
-   Ensuring there are opportunities for learning and development
-   Providing support if required

Adjust constraints incrementally, considering capabilities, reliability and outcome.

Decentralize as much as possible, and retain as much influence as necessary.
